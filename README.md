Continuous Inspection configurations
====================================

This project holds our configurations for the different Continuous Inspection/Integration services which help us make better code.

[(Scrutinizer CI][scrutinizer_url]
--------------

Scrutinizer CI is a hosted continuous inspection service for open-source as well as private code.

It runs static code analysis tools, runtime inspectors, and can also run your very own checks in your favorite language.

The configuration can be found in the .scrutinizer.yml file
